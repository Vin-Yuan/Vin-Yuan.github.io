A value that is already "built in" to a function. 

Example: imagine a function that works out the height of a tree:

**h(year) = 20 × year**

then "20" is a parameter.

Parameters can be changed so that the function can be used for other things. 
Example: A different tree's growth rate is 30 cm per year, so its function is **h(year) = 30 × year**

We could even make it more general by writing

**h(age; rate) = rate × age**

and in this case a semicolon (;) is used to separate the variable(s) from the parameters(s)
